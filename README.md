# LIRI-node-app

## Process
I created a command line Node app that takes in parameters and gives back data, specifically around upcoming shows for bands/artists using
the bandsintown API, song and album info using the Spotify API, and movie info using the OMDB API. The biggest issue I ran into on the
assignment was around the Spotify API. It had arrays inside arrays inside objects that were sort of tricky to drill into and retrieve the
required information. I wouldn't have been able to get that part if it weren't for some help from other developers.

## Technologies Used
The program was written entirely with Javascript, using Moment and Axios NPM packages to help with time format changes and API calls.
